# Accepted Additions and Requests

One of the reasons I built bugloos_player was out of frustration with other FOSS android music players, which had too many features, frustrating UI/UX flaws, or both. Therefore any additions will have to be accepted by **me** (hamidfathi1998) before they are implemented or merged.

## Bug Fixes, Optimizations, Architecture Improvements, etc.

These will likely be accepted as long as they do not cause too much harm to the codebase.

## New Customizations/Options

While I do like adding new behavior/UI customizations, these will be looked at more closely as certain additions can cause harm to the apps UI/UX while not providing alot of benefit. These tend to be accepted however.

## Feature Addtions and UI Changes

These arent as likely to be accepted. As I said, I do not want bugloos_player to become overly bloated with features that are rarely used, therefore I only tend to accept features that:

- Benefit **my own** usage
- Are in line with Bugloos-Player purpose as a music player

This does not rule out these additions, but they are not accepted as often as others. I will also hold off adding features until I'm able to implement them without disruption or strange behaviors.

Feel free to fork bugloos_player to add your own feature set however.
